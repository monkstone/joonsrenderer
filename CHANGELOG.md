**v1.3.0** Bump for janino-3.1.2, and jdk11

**v1.2.0** Bump for janino-3.0.12, plus some refactoring

**v1.1.3** Bump for processing-3.3.4

**v1.1.2** Use sunflow.util.FloatList and IntList, netbeans profiling suggest it is worth doing (there is a vanilla processing alternative, with a different interface)  

**v1.1.1** Left out GLASS from fill type switch easily fixed though

**v1.1.0** I'm conflicted about versioning here, this a later version than Joon Hyub Lee joonsrenderer. What is different is sunflow is integrated and updated (switch on String, try with resources etc, and importantly updated janino). I have also hacked joons renderer a bit as well.
