A gem to use the sunflow (raytacer) with JRubyArt and propane. Pretty quick and dirty stuff, if you are really serious you might choose to export processing sketch to some 3D format, parse that through [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/) to clean it up before rendering with [blender](https://www.blender.org/) but for everyone else this is pretty easy.
